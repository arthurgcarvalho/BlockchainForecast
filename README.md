# BlockchainForecast

This project contains the source code of the major artifacts proposed in the paper "Aligning the Interests of Newsvendors and Forecasters Through Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts and Proper Scoring Rules".

The folder *smart contract* has the code concerning the development of a forecast contract.

The folder DApp has the code of the decentralized application that allows newsvendors and forecasters to interact with the smart contract.

A running version of the DApp is available at https://arthurcarvalho.info/apps/blockchainforecast.
